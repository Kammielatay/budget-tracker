# Budget Tracker

## Description

Having a budget is not always easy. And it is even easier to spend money. Let me help you keep track of the money you have coming in and the money you have going out. 

The user will be able to add expenses and deposit to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, it will populate the total when the user is back online.
